In this question we are sending date from user spcae to kernel space using _cpy_from_user function and copy_to_user function to copy date from kernel spcae to user spcae.
I am sending 2-D floating point array from user space to kernel spcae along with destination array and no. of 
rows and columns to calculate size. Now I am just using copy from array and copy to user function to do requires task.
